  - [ ] Result Pagination
  - [x] Display top albums by default
  - [x] When search display search results instead of default

- [ ] Fix poster-preview responsiveness, especialy the tracks growing beyonde the screen.

- [ ] Some albums like Floating Points Promises do not return tracks. Make tracks Optional

- [ ] Add Skeleton to images

  - [ ] Add Skeleton to album-card imaga
  - [ ] Add Skeleton to poster-preview image

- [ ] Extract all function that fetch data from lastFM to a single file. -[x] It's on a actions file now for server side logic, but it's probably still best to separate
